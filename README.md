This is my Deckbuilder program for Assigneent 5. It can take a users custom card, store the list of current cards in its JSON file, deal cards from the top of the deck to the user, shuffle the cards, reset back to a basic standard deck, and it has a view deck button to update the listview.

I used the Newtonsoft.Json package on visual studio to achieve this.
