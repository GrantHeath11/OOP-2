This is my Deckbuilder program for Assignment 5. It can take a user's custom card, store the list of current cards in its JSON file, deal cards from the top of the deck to the user, shuffle the cards, reset back to a basic standard deck, and it has a "View Deck" button to update the ListView.

I used the Newtonsoft.Json package in Visual Studio to achieve this.
